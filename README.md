# FWMS - Fire Water Management System

This is a script designed to add additional roleplay opportunities to FD's in FiveM communities to have more realistic fire-related RP by creating adding a water level to all fire trucks. 

Basic functionality allows users to retrieve a fire extinguisher from a nearby engine, and as the person uses the fire extinguisher, the water level of that truck will decrease. Water level can be increased by connecting the truck to a hydrant.
